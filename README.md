# SQL-Query-Parser
Built a LL(1) parser for parsing SQL queries. The parser is built using Java language in eclipse. Grammar designed to recognize most of  the complex SQL queries. LL(1) is a top-down parser where I computed the first and follow sets for the grammar, generate a parsing  table and checking the validity of SQL query with the stack implementation.
